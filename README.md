Source code for 'A Multi-Strategy based Pre-Training Method for Cold-Start Recommendation'

This is our Tensorflow implementation:

Environment Requirement The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.12. The required packages are as follows:

tensorflow == 1.14.0 numpy == 1.16.0 tqdm == 4.50.2 scipy == 1.5.2 torch == 1.3.1

Runing instructions: We test our model on three datasets, namely MovieLens-1M, MOOCs and Gowalla.

run 'python Recommendation.py' to test our codes.
